Hello my name is Jari and I am a student at HAMK University of Applied Sciences. I am currently studying in the Information Technology program, specializing in Software Development. I have a strong passion for technology and programming, and I am eager to learn and grow in this field. I have experience in various programming languages and technologies, and I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. I am excited to be a part of the HAMK community and I look forward to connecting with fellow students and professionals in the IT industry.


## Past Experiences

I have worked on several projects during my studies, including developing a web application for a local business, creating a mobile app for a community organization, and contributing to open-source projects on GitHub. I have also completed internships where I gained hands-on experience in software development and project management. These experiences have allowed me to apply my theoretical knowledge in real-world scenarios and have helped me develop valuable skills in teamwork, communication, and problem-solving.

## Future Goals

In the future, I aspire to become a proficient software developer and contribute to innovative projects that make a positive impact on society. I am particularly interested in areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cloud computing. I plan to continue learning and improving my skills through further education, certifications, and practical experience. Ultimately, I hope to work in a dynamic and collaborative environment where I can contribute to meaningful projects and grow both personally and professionally.
